 If you implement a willSet observer, itâ€™s passed the new property value as a constant parameter. You can specify a name for this parameter as part of your willSet implementation. If you donâ€™t write the parameter name and parentheses within your implementation, the parameter is made available with a default parameter name of newValue.

 Similarly, if you implement a didSet observer, itâ€™s passed a constant parameter containing the old property value. You can name the parameter or use the default parameter name of oldValue. If you assign a value to a property within its own didSet observer, the new value that you assign replaces the one that was just set.

 A property wrapper adds a layer of separation between code that manages how a property is stored and the code that defines a property. For example, if you have properties that provide thread- safety checks or store their underlying data in a database, you have to write that code on every property. When you use a property wrapper, you write the management code once when you define the wrapper, and then reuse that management code by applying it to multiple properties.

// MARK: - Projecting a Value From a Property Wrapper

/*
 In addition to the wrapped value, a property wrapper can expose additional functionality by defining a projected valueâ€”for example, a property wrapper that manages access to a database can expose a flushDatabaseConnection() method on its projected value. The name of the projected value is the same as the wrapped value, except it begins with a dollar sign ($). Because your code canâ€™t define properties that start with $ the projected value never interferes with properties you define.
 
 In the SmallNumber example above, if you try to set the property to a number thatâ€™s too large, the property wrapper adjusts the number before storing it. The code below adds a projectedValue property to the SmallNumber structure to keep track of whether the property wrapper adjusted the new value for the property before storing that new value.
